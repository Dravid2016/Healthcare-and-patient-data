Transforming healthcare with AI-powered disease prediction based on patient data

AI-Powered Disease Prediction Using Data Science

Abstract

This project uses core data science techniques to predict disease risk based on patient health data. We analyze real-world datasets through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering. Traditional machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest are applied to classify disease likelihood. The aim is to support early detection and provide interpretable insights that can aid in better healthcare decisions.

Introduction

The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of patient data, offering opportunities to derive valuable insights using data science. Early detection of diseases plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing treatment costs. This project focuses on using patient health records to build predictive models that can estimate the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes or heart conditions. By applying data science techniques—including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and traditional machine learning algorithms—this project aims to assist healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate decisions.

Existing System

Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on manual assessment of patient data, clinical tests, and expert opinions. These approaches are often time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. Although some hospitals have started using electronic health records (EHR), many systems still lack automation and analytical capabilities to support disease prediction. In the existing system, early diagnosis is largely reactive rather than predictive, often leading to delayed treatment and increased risk.

Proposed System

The proposed system introduces a data science-based approach to automate disease prediction using machine learning. It utilizes historical patient data to train classification models that can predict the likelihood of disease occurrence. The system involves data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. This predictive tool can serve as a decision support system for healthcare providers, allowing them to identify high-risk patients early and initiate timely intervention. It also enhances consistency, speed, and objectivity in the diagnosis process.
